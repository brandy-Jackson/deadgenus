<p class="ps1"><a id="doc1"></a><strong><span class="s1">UNDERGRADUATE ESSAY FORMAT</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="s2">About This Template</span></p>
<p class="ps3">This template is designed for writing and formatting an undergraduate essay suitable for humanities subjects. It is based on a format used at several UK universities (such as Cambridge). Bear in mind, however, that many universities have different formatting requirements, so you should check the exact guidelines of the institution to which you are submitting your paper.</p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s3">How To Use This Template</span></p>
<p class="ps3">Edit the “Title” document so that it contains the title of your essay, your instructor’s name and so on. (Leave “2023-02-06”, as that is a placeholder that will be replaced with the current date during compile.)</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Compose your essay in text documents inside the “Main Content” folder. Whether you use a single document or multiple text files to write your essay is entirely up to you—just make sure they are all inside the “Main Content” folder.</p>
<p class="ps6"><em><span class="s4">⁠</span></em><strong><em><span class="s5">Note:</span></em></strong> The “Essay” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Essay” in this template.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Indent block quotes or other special passages using styles. For instance, to add a block quote, choose “Block Quote” from the <strong><span class="s6">Format &#62; Style</span></strong> menu (or from the styles button in the format bar).</p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Tables and Figures</span></p>
<p class="ps3">If you need to use tables or figures in your essay, you can label them using the following tags, replacing “KEYWORD” with a unique word that identifies your table or figure.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">!fig(KEYWORD)</p>
<p class="ps3">!table(KEYWORD)</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">These tags will be replaced with numbers in the compiled document, with the numbering stream for figures being separate from the numbering stream for tables.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">You can refer to such tags as follows:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">#fig(KEYWORD)</p>
<p class="ps3">#table(KEYWORD)</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Table !table(sales): Sales 2011</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Table !table(dates): Shipment dates</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Figure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in </span><em><span class="s8">Firefly</span></em><span class="s7">.</span></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">… (For sales figures, see table #table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table #table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure #fig(skeleton))… </span><em><span class="s8">Chronicles</span></em><span class="s7"> providing a similar role, albeit without the </span><em><span class="s8">Castle</span></em><span class="s7"> actor (see figure #fig(malcolmreynolds)).</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Table 1: Sales 2011</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Table 2: Shipment dates</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Figure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">Figure 2: The second coolest character in </span><em><span class="s8">Firefly</span></em><span class="s7">.</span></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="s7">… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… </span><em><span class="s8">Chronicles</span></em><span class="s7"> providing a similar role, albeit without the </span><em><span class="s8">Castle</span></em><span class="s7"> actor (see figure 2).</span></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Compiling</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">

</ol>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Sample Document</span></p>
<p class="ps3">The “Example Essay” PDF file in the Research folder shows how the essay will look when compiled.</p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="s3">Final Note</span></p>
<p class="ps3">Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to students. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using <strong><span class="s6">File &#62; Save As Template…</span></strong></p>
